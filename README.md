# MyFirstCppApp

Here is my first Cpp application prototype.

I publish it here and here is a guide how to use it :

1) choose a language : type fr or en.

2) type 2 words randomly

3) check if the result is fine, or if you want to reverse it.

4) end of the application prototype

5) restart the application manually if you want

TIPS: If you want to simplify theorical calculus with scientific symbols, you can do it by changing the output of the method FuseWord.
      TODO that, you only need to change the result string output by implementing an equal sign at the spot you want it to be displayed.

Potential outcome for this feature : seeking for a strategy to handle more than two words, building a data base of words to treat to one another, seeking for the most simple result through the chain not to get over the chain caracter number limit...

I still need to learn more about Cpp about memory management, then my statement may not be correct.
But from that prototype application, it makes it easier to understand if we make it recursive.

This is a new prototype operator which role is to simplify operations between abstract variables represented by letters combination conventions.

Howewer yet, I made it on this way to simply fuse words which definitions may be related to the current breaking news.

Feel free to reuse the result in the google search bar, and seek for other sections like books or anything else, you may find unexcepted result.

Enjoy the process and leave a comment please, or any advice will be welcomed to guide me for the future.
